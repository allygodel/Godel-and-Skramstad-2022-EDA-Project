## Introduction

As SARS-CoV-2 began its tyranny throughout the world, many variables of
everyone's life were altered in order to battle this change. Along with
excessive hand washing, toilet paper hoarding, and Zoom stocks
skyrocketing, how education was given and received was altered in both
good and bad ways during this panic. Using the comparison of positive
tests regarding both SARS-CoV-2 and Influenza in 2018-2019 allows us to
visually observe the differences in how these viruses caused change
throughout the education system.

## Methods

Website // button clicked // which dataset taken // Websites used:
\><https://gis.cdc.gov/> In order to get to the Influenza dataset, a
simple "Influenza" search in the top right search bar will result in
several datasets. The data set titled "Data Visualization and
Interactive Mapping for Flu Surveillance \| Place and Health" will be
where we find our dataset. Once this link is clicked, a web page
explaining the Flu Mapping tool will lead you to the "FluView
Interactive" tool, which is located under the heading "Interactive Flu
Surveillance. Once this link is clicked, we can simply follow the prompt
to "view both influenza laboratory data and medically attend visits for
influenza-like illnessâ€¦". Once on this interactive page, we specify our
"Season" as 2018-2019, then observe the data produced on the "Stacked
Column Chart WHO/NREVSS". This dataset allows us to see who was
previously affected by influenza in the year 2018-2019. \>

will be able to view any data presented on this website. By specifying
and clicking "COVID-19" under the "Special Topics", you are able to
scroll down and find the "Education Indicators" topic, which will house
our data set under the "School Age" section. We are able to open the
dataset "Change in how households with children received education due
to the coronavirus pandemic", which houses a portion of the dataset
used. By selecting "View U.S. Data", you will be able to view any data
presented on this website. By specifying and clicking "Education" under
the "Topics" tab, you are able to scroll down and find the "School Age"
topic, which will house our data set under the "Children who missed 11
or more days of school per year due to illness or injury".
Specifications of year can be made. In this case, 2018-2019 was viewed
and used in this dataset. \> <https://covidtracking.com/data/download>
This website allows you to download specific state information regarding
trends during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. For this research, we will be
using the "summary data for the United States", which can be downloaded
