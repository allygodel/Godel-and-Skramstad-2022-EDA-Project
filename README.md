### Abstract

Beginning in March of 2020, Corona Virus quickly swept the nation, leaving many unanswered questions about how the virus affects the population. This project intends to explore how education in children is impacted by the coronavirus and create a comparative representation of influenza’s impact on child education. The project will be carried out using data sets collected from reputable resources and a clear picture of the data that will answer questions about the Corona Virus’s impact on education in students ages 6-17. We will explore changes in how students received education when COVID-19 started and absences due to illness or injury before COVID-19. This project will give us a better understanding of how education is affected during a pandemic and start conversations about improving education during uncertain times.
